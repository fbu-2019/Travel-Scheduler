# Travellama

**Travellama** is a travel scheduler app that creates customized travel itineraries based on the user's selected destinations and travel periods. Complete with local attractions information, a flexible and customizable schedule, and commute/map information, this app greatly simplifies the travel planning process and allows you to enjoy the wonders of travelling without the stress of scheduling.

**How it works:**

- user can create an account and login or skip for now. This is followed by selecting a city to travel to and providing start/end dates for the travel period. Using this information, the app will generate a bunch of locations in and around the destined city

- user can select places they want to visit by hitting the checkmark and they will automatically be sorted to the front for easy access and indication

- user can also click into each place and get more details including visiting the official website and seeing popular reviews

- user can manually search for a location they want to visit if they can't find it in the provided list (note in this video there is a bug where the icon doesn't match the location but this is fixed)

- user can change attractions to be locked at specific times of day ("locking" ensures that for future re-generations of schedules, the event always stays in that locked time period if possible)

- when finalized schedule is created, user can add the events to their apple calendar (both individually for each event or adding all events using the button on the top right of the screen). User can also remove added events individually.
